The project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease in patients.By analyzing a heart disease patient dataset obtained from Kaggle, I conducted thorough data processing and exploration. I trained and evaluated various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier and K-Neighbors Classifier, to accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease presence based on input features.
The implementation was carried out in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
